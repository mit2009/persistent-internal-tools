# CADLab Persistent Internal Tools (aka the PIT)
Hello! This is where one-off scripts that are used in a semi-frequent basis will live. 
Currently, there is the:

1. Slack Archiver - this script helps archive a large number of channels. A bot joins each channel, and then proceeds to archive them. You can unarchive them by modifying a couple lines in the code. Have fun!
